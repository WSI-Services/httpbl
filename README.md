WSI-Services httpBL
===================
PHP library for checking IPv4 addresses against Project Honey Pots Blacklist.  An API key from Project Honey Pot is required to utilize this library.  You can create an account and obtain an API key by [creating an account](http://www.projecthoneypot.org/create_account.php) at [Project Honey Pot](http://www.projecthoneypot.org).

About Project Honey Pot
====
<img style="float:right; border: 1px solid #d7d7d7; padding: 4px;" src="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/images/target.gif" alt="Project Honey Pot">
Project Honey Pot is the first and only distributed system for identifying spammers and the spambots they use to scrape addresses from your website. Using the Project Honey Pot system, you can install addresses that are custom-tagged to the time and IP address of a visitor to your site. If one of these addresses begins receiving email, not only can they tell that the messages are spam, but also the exact moment when the address was harvested and the IP address that gathered it.

HTTP Blacklist
----
The HTTP Blacklist, or "http:BL", is a system that allows website administrators to take advantage of the data generated by Project Honey Pot in order to keep suspicious and malicious web robots off their sites. Project Honey Pot tracks harvesters, comment spammers, and other suspicious visitors to websites. Http:BL makes this data available to any member of Project Honey Pot in an easy and efficient way.

Http:BL provides data back about the IP addresses of visitors to your website. Data is exchanged over DNS. You may query your local DNS server and receive a response back that indicates the type of visitor to your site, how threatening that visitor is, and how long it's been since the visitor has last been seen within the Project Honey Pot trap network.

Installing WSI-Services httpBL
====

GIT
----
Clone the GIT repository locally:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/WSI-Services/httpbl.git
```

Composer
----
Add the required sections to your `composer.json` file:

```json
"require": {
	"wsiservices/httpbl": "dev-master"
},
"repositories": [
	{
		"type": "git",
		"url": "https://github.com/WSI-Services/httpbl.git"
	}
]
```

Using httpBL
====

Namespace
----

```php
use WSIServices\httpBL;
```

Class: httpBL
----

```php
$httpBlacklist = new httpBL\httpBL($apiKey);
$response = $httpBlacklist->lookup($ipAddress);
```

Class: response
----

```php
if($response->inBlacklist()) {
	echo 'Response Time-To-Live: '
		.$response->getTtl().PHP_EOL;

	$responseType = $reponse->getType();

	echo 'Visitor Type Id      : '
		.$responseType.PHP_EOL;
	echo 'Visitor Type         : '
		.$response->getTypeName($responseType).PHP_EOL;

	if($responseType === httpBL\response::VISITOR_SEARCH_ENGINE) {
		$searchEngineId = $response->getSearchEngine();

		echo 'Search Engine Id     : '
			.$searchEngineId.PHP_EOL;
		echo 'Search Engine        : '
			.$response->getSearchEngineName($searchEngineId).PHP_EOL;
	} else {
		echo 'Threat Score         : '
			.$response->getThreatScore().PHP_EOL;
		echo 'Last Active          : '
			.$response->getLastActive().PHP_EOL;
	}
} else {
	echo 'Visitor ('.$response->getIpAddress()
		.') is not in the blacklist.'.PHP_EOL;
}
```

If you would like to perform live tests with your Project Honey Pot API key, edit file `test\httpBLLookupLiveTest.php` and locate the following line.

```php
define('WSIServices\httpBL\PROJECT_HONEYPOT_API_KEY', 'abcdefghijkl');
```

Replace `abcdefghijkl` with the API key provided to you by Project Honey Pot.
